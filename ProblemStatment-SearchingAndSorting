Problem Statement: Student Grades Management System
You are tasked with creating a Student Grades Management System for a school. The system uses a linked list to store the following information for each student:

Student ID (unique integer)
Name (string)
Grade (integer from 0 to 100)
The linked list may have the data in unsorted order.

Your goal is to perform the following operations:

Sort Students by Grades:
Write a function to sort the linked list based on the Grade in descending order. If two students have the same grade, they should be sorted alphabetically by Name.

Search for a Student:
After sorting, implement a search function to find a student by their Student ID. Return the details of the student if found, or indicate that the student is not in the list.

Example Input:
Unsorted Linked List:

Edit
[ {ID: 102, Name: "Alice", Grade: 78} -> 
  {ID: 101, Name: "Bob", Grade: 85} -> 
  {ID: 103, Name: "Charlie", Grade: 85} -> 
  {ID: 104, Name: "David", Grade: 67} ]
Operations:
Sorting Output:
After sorting by grades (and names for ties), the linked list should look like:

Edit
[ {ID: 101, Name: "Bob", Grade: 85} -> 
  {ID: 103, Name: "Charlie", Grade: 85} -> 
  {ID: 102, Name: "Alice", Grade: 78} -> 
  {ID: 104, Name: "David", Grade: 67} ]
Search Output:
If searching for Student ID = 103:

Edit
Output: {ID: 103, Name: "Charlie", Grade: 85}
If searching for Student ID = 105:

Output: Student not found.
Constraints:
The linked list can have up to 10^5 nodes.
Sorting must be done in place without using extra arrays.
Searching should be efficient after sorting.
